## Abstract

A methodology is introduced for smoothing the complex transfer function of measured responses using well-established or arbitrary fractional-octave profiles, based on a novel time-frequency mapping framework. A corresponding impulse response, also derived analytically, has reduced complexity but conforms to perceptual princples. The relationship between complex smoothing and traditional power spectral smoothing is also discussed.
